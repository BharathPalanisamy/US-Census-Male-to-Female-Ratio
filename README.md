## Project Overview ##
 This project uses US Census data to analyze the male-to-female population ratio in the United States over the past 10 years (2013-2022). 
 The goal is to visualize the trends in population distribution between genders and display the overall population in millions.

## Technologies Used ##
  
  **Python**  <br>
  **Pandas** <br>
  **MatPlotLib**  <br>
  **US Census Bureau API**  <br>

## How to run this project
1.1 Install Juypter notebook
- pip install jupyterlab : Work on the project on Juypter notebook.

1.2 Set up an environment variable for the Census API key
